<!-- step 2 how to list an array of objects *ngFor Angular array-->
<ul class="employees">
    <!-- Step 3 make the list clickable by adding (click)="onSelect(object instance) event binding" -->
    <!-- step 4 class binding can be added with a conditional -->
    <li *ngFor="let employee of employees"

<!-- because this app will load selectedEmployee is undefined, therefore conditional applied to show div only when data can be provided, which is done in this case by the event binding to the above list items -->
<div *ngIf="selectedEmployee">
